          <h2>Mood Music</h2>
            <p>Hardly a day goes by that I am not looking for new music to keep me going! Whether it's homework, video games, or driving, I am always on Spotify listening to my favorite music.</p>
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>
          <h2>Quick Pick Me-Up</h2>
            <p>While I honestly spend more time than I should browsing the endless black hole that is reddit, I do find myself scrawling through a few pages pretty frequently.This reddit page, for instance, is always good for a smile and comes coupled with some of the most wholesome imagery on the internet.</p>

          <h2>Time Killer</h2>
            <p>Whenever I am stuck waiting in line, traveling, or just killing time before work, there's a decent chance that you can find me killing time on Sudoku.com</p>
