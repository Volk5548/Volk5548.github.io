        		Dave Grohl is commonly known as one of the most genuine and accesible people in the world of Rock n' Roll. He is a constant reminder that success doesn't have to come with a big ego, and that remaining humble is one of the most endearing qualities a person can have.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		He has done many things for others such as:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Supporting Charities - He has donated millions to 21st Century Leaders, Worldwide Orphans, and Teen Cancer America to name a few</li>
        		<li>Always has time for Fans - He is widely known for pulling fans onstage, helping out injured concertgoers, and even going to fans garage shows to play with them.r</li>
        		<li>Put's on Fundraising Shows - recently he raised $354,903 for the Christchurch, New Zealand Earthquake by putting on a benefit show</li>
        		<li>Helps Out wherever He Can - Whether it's Make-A-Wish dreams, tipping waiter's $1000 each time he goes out, or cooking barbecue for California Firefighters, he is consistently generous with his time and money.</li>
        		<li>The Show Must Go On - He has subbed in for sick musicians and even played through a show with a broken leg!  </li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Since he exemplifies how to live life with a smile and to alway's stay thankful for what you have, Dave Grohl has always inspired me to be a better person.
